    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A traditional lasagna, with about half the time and effort! I always cook
      extra to have leftovers, but the more I cook, the more they eat! Serve
      with garlic toast and salad.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ground of beef</li>
      <li>1 pinch of basil</li>
      <li>Lasange pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over
        medium-high heat. Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and black
        olives, and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper,
        minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring
        frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking
        dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta
        cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese.
        Cover with another layer of sauce, and repeat layering ending with the
        meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for
        later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes
        depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can
        easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top,
        and return to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice melted cheese
        topping.
      </li>
