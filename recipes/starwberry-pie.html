    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my favorite pie. It is very easy to make. I got the recipe many
      years ago in North Jersey. It is from the Sussex County Strawberry Farms.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked</li>
      <li>1 quart fresh strawberries</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Arrange half of strawberries in baked pastry shell. Mash remaining
        berries and combine with sugar in a medium saucepan. Place saucepan over
        medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and water. Gradually stir
        cornstarch mixture into boiling strawberry mixture. Reduce heat and
        simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly.
        Pour mixture over berries in pastry shell.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chill for several hours before serving. In a small bowl, whip cream
        until soft peaks form. Serve each slice of pie with a dollop of whipped
        cream.
